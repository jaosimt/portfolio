	<p>Kadaugan sa Mactan (or the Victory in Mactan) is a celebration reenacting the victory of Mactan people
		(Oponganons) during the famous “Battle of Mactan” in the 16th century.</p>
	<h3>Brief History</h3>
	<span>The bloody Battle of Mactan took place in April 27, 1521 when the iron-clad soldiers of Ferdinand Magellan reach
		the shores of the island but was fiercely confronted by Chief Lapu-Lapu and his fighters.</span><br />
	<span>During the confrontation, the Portuguese explorer lost the battle and met his fate together with most of his
		soldiers. Most historians have agreed that the event actually took place and there is no doubt that it
		happened.</span><br />
	<div className="inline-image"
	     style={ { backgroundPosition: 'center', backgroundSize: 'cover', backgroundImage: `url(${ kadaugan2 })` } } />
	<br />
	<h3>A battle won! Or is it?</h3>
	<span>This year, 2021, We are commemorating the 500th anniversary of the arrival of Christianity in the Philippines. BSP
		even printed a Php5000 Lapu-lapu commemorative banknote with the Quincentennial Commemoration logo in it.</span><br />
	<div className="inline-image" style={ { backgroundSize: 'cover', backgroundImage: `url(${ fiveK })` } } />
	<br />
	<h3>Did Chief Lapu-lapu embraced Christianity?</h3>
	<span>I think not! He fought and won! And probably died hating it... Or not liking it at-least.</span><br />
	<div style={ {
		backgroundColor: '#000',
		color: "#FFF",
		fontWeight: 'bold',
		justifyContent: 'flex-start',
		flexDirection: 'column',
		padding: '14px 21px'
	} }>
		<h1 style={ { margin: 0, lineHeight: 0.7 } }>com·mem·o·rate</h1>
		<span>recall and show respect for (someone or something)</span>
	</div>
	<br />
	<div className="inline-image"
	     style={ { backgroundSize: 'cover', minHeight: 300, backgroundImage: `url(${ moreDecals })` } } />
	<br />
	<h3>So who or what are we commemorating?</h3>
	<span>Is it Chief Lapu-lapu? His bravery for standing his ground against the colonizers? And it's highly likely that religion is amongst the reason he stood his ground and fought.</span>
	<p>None of these make any sense to me at all!</p>
	<p>We are not respecting Chief Lapu-lapu if we're infusing the very same thing, religion or someone else's tradition
		that he probably fought against, especially during the celebration of what is supposed to be <strong
			className="italic">The Kadaugan sa Mactan</strong>.</p>
	<p>This is my humble opinion and my opinion alone.</p>
	<p>And so, I am asking....</p>
	<h3>Did he really win?</h3>

			"It is possible that—like what is hypothesized for H. floresiensis from Flores, Indonesia—H. luzonensis
			descended
			from an early H. erectus dispersal across Southeast Asia. It is also possible that these two insular archaic
			humans descend from an entirely different Homo species <strong>possibly earlier than H. erectus</strong>."</span>
	<p>So ...</p>
	<span>1) Homo Luzonensis is old!</span>

	<br />
	<div className="inline-image" style={ { backgroundImage: `url(${ qwerty })` } } />
	<h3>Let’s talk about how to install it first and foremost.</h3>
	<p>Follow the instructions from this incredible blog post: <a
		href="//nordenx.blogspot.com/2012/05/baybayin-unicode-keyboard-layout-for.html" target="_blank"
		rel="noreferrer">Baybayin
		Unicode Keyboard Layout</a></p>
	<p>It got keyboards for Windows, Mac and Linux with its corresponding instructions. Like I said, Incredible
		blog!</p>
	<h3>In Mac OSX, given you’d setup yours correctly, the keyboard selection should look like this:</h3>
	<div className="inline-image" style={ { backgroundImage: `url(${ baybayinInMac })` } } />
	<h3>All you have to do is select the Baybayin keyboard and type on with it.</h3>
	<span>Easy right? Well, I would say not quite. Here’s why:</span>
	<p>
		As you can see on the keyboard layout (credits to <a
		href="//nordenx.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">nordenx.blogspot.com</a>), the baybayin
		characters
		are laid out to their corresponding latin characters and it means exactly what it is. The problem is, most of
		us
		do not pay attention to such details. And besides we are used to typing with the latin scripts.
	</p>
	<p>What do I mean by that? Well, consider the following words and the ways on how we would be typing them.</p>
	<h3>Kamusta (How are you)</h3>
	<ul style={ { marginTop: 0 } }>
		<li>
			Using latin/roman keys, obviously it is the combination of individual keys: <strong>k, a, m, u, s, t &
			a</strong>; This is what we all got used to typing
		</li>
		<li>Using Baybayin with the above typing habit will produce: <span className="bold bybyn">ᜃᜋᜓᜐᜆ</span> which
			translates to <strong>kamusata</strong></li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Magaling (Good)</h3>
	<ul style={ { marginTop: 0 } }>
		<li>With the same latin/roman typing ways on baybayin keyboard will produce: <span
			className="bold bybyn">ᜋᜄᜎᜒᜈᜄ</span> which translates to <strong>magalinaga</strong></li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Maaga (Early)</h3>
	<ul style={ { marginTop: 0 } }>
		<li><span className="bold bybyn">ᜋᜄ</span> which translates to <strong>maga</strong></li>
	</ul>
	<h3>What do you think is wrong?</h3>
	<p>With baybayin keyboard, <strong>always type baybayin with your caps lock OFF.</strong></p>
	<p>Now, typing characters like you are typing them using the latin/roman keyboard will NOT work! And yes, you will
		have a bunch of typos if you won’t disconnect yourself from the latin/roman typing ways.</p>
	<p>Why? Baybayin characters are not really letters. <strong>They are syllables, except the vowels and the ones
		with
		a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virama" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">virama</a></strong>. Meaning,
		and by default, each baybayin “characters” are a pair of one consonant (or two with the syllable nga) and a
		vowel.
		Again, except the vowels and the ones with a virama.</p>
	<p>How typing works in baybayin keyboard? The default is a pair of <strong>one consonant</strong> (or two for nga)
		and the vowel <strong>a</strong>.</p>
	<p>For example the <span className="bold bybyn">ᜃ</span> character; A press on the key <strong>k</strong> on your
		keyboard will show the <strong>ka (<span className="bybyn">ᜃ</span>)</strong> character. So if you only need it
		to
		be just the <strong>k</strong>, you need to press the <strong>equal sign (=)</strong> key after it. That is how
		we
		bring the virama to disemvowel a syllable.</p>
	<p>On that note, typing <strong>kamusta</strong> using baybayin keyboard is either one of two ways. A combination
		of
		key presses as follows:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>k, mo, s=</strong> and <strong>t</strong></li>
		<li><strong>ka, mo, s=</strong> and <strong>ta</strong></li>
	</ul>
	<p>How about the word <strong>magaling</strong>? Well, just the same. What’s special here is
		the <strong>ng</strong>.
		Typing ng directly will produce <span className="bold bybyn">ᜈᜄ</span> which translates
		to <strong>naga</strong>.
		That would make it <strong>magalinaga</strong> as shown above which is needless to say that it is wrong.</p>
	<p>If I would call it a trick, like how the virama is brought up, the character/letter case also plays an
		important
		role in the baybayin keyboard typing. Thus the word <strong>magaling</strong> was chosen for this purpose.</p>
	<p>Look back up when I noted to always type with you caps lock OFF, simply because of a few things. One is the
		distinction between the <strong>na (<span className="bybyn">ᜈ</span>)</strong> and <strong>nga (<span
			className="bybyn">ᜅ</span>)</strong> syllables.</p>
	<p>Typing it is one of two ways again and are as follows:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>m, g, li</strong> and <strong>N=</strong></li>
		<li><strong>ma, ga, li</strong> and <strong>Na=</strong></li>
	</ul>
	<p>That’s right, a little bit weird, maybe crazy… but that is how it works. Perhaps a specification on typing such
		is
		just lying around somewhere but I haven’t been able to find it yet. If there’s any.</p>
	<p>Did you notice how the <strong>uppercase or the capital letter plays an important role</strong>? That’s right
		if
		you noticed. If not, typing <strong>n</strong> will bring the syllable <strong>na (<span
			className="bybyn">ᜈ</span>)</strong> while typing <strong>N</strong> will bring the syllable <strong>nga
			(<span
				className="bybyn">ᜅ</span>)</strong>. And this is why the character/letter case plays an important role
		in
		baybayin keyboard.</p>
	<p>How about the word <strong>maaga</strong>?</p>
	<p>Whenever you need to be typing <strong>a vowel after a vowel</strong>, the same uppercase letter role plays the
		part. One of two ways yet again and are as follows:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>m, A</strong> and <strong>g</strong></li>
		<li><strong>ma, A</strong> and <strong>ga</strong></li>
	</ul>
	<p>The same is true when you are typing any vowel as the first character. For
		example: <strong>aklat</strong>, <strong>ilog</strong> and <strong>ulo</strong> amongst others.</p>
	<p>So, the next time that you would see such writing, you should know that the latin/roman key presses equivalents
		are as follows:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span className="bybyn">ᜃᜋᜓᜐ᜔ᜆ</span> ➛ <strong>kmus=t</strong> or <strong>kamus=ta</strong></li>
		<li><span className="bybyn">ᜋᜄᜎᜒᜅ᜔</span> ➛ <strong>mgliN=</strong> or <strong>magaliNa=</strong></li>
		<li><span className="bybyn">ᜋᜀᜄ</span> ➛ <strong>mAg</strong> or <strong>maAga</strong></li>
	</ul>
	<p>That’s it! Once you keep all that in mind? You will be typing baybayin like you’re doing it with latin/roman
		scripts.</p>
	<h3>Common mistakes</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Thinking of Baybayin as a Language.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>It is <strong>not!</strong></li>
			<li>Baybayin is a <strong>writing system!</strong></li>
		</ul>
		<li>Writing Baybayin with <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_alphabet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">English
			Alphabet</a> in mind.
		</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Is <strong>Wrong!</strong></li>
