	<p>Pinoy Keyboard is a baybayin B17+ keyboard extension.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, due to the fact that I am not ready to pay google app store yet ðŸ˜‚, I did not publish it. However,
		at your own risk, if you are technical enough to install manually, you can do so by downloading Pinoy Keyboard
		extension app for andriod in <a href={ pinoyKeyboardApk } target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>! Rest assured,
		that it is safe and no hidden agenda whatsoever! It is just a straight keyboard extension application that a
		handful of people are already using.</p>
	<div className="inline-image" style={ { backgroundImage: `url(${ pinoyKeyboardToggle })`, height: '300px' } } />
	<p>Above illustration shows a key that toggles the keyboard characters from baybayin to roman/latin and/or vice
		versa. Ideal for those who are still studying and beginners alike in baybayin.</p>
	<p>As you can see, character placement are ordered left-to-right with <strong>ba ka da ga ha la ma</strong> and
		etc... respectively for easy remembering with the <a
			href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abakada_alphabet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Abakada</a> alphabet in where
		baybayin and other Philipine scripts are based of.</p>
	<p>The topmost 3 keys are nothing more than a vowel selector. Normally, baybayin characters are syllables by default
		with the vowel <strong>a</strong>. However, for easy transition from the typical typing that we all used to with
		the roman/latin keys, I thought, that it would be easier to start with the same. Meaning, with this keyboard, the
		keys starts with the <b><i>pamatay pantining</i></b> or <b><i>disemvowelment</i></b> of the default syllable
		baybayin character/s.</p>
	<p>That said, when you type <span
		className="bybyn bold x-large">áœŠ</span> or <strong className="x-large">b</strong>, you will have the
		character <span
			className="bybyn bold x-large">áœŠáœ”</span>. And if that is not your intention, you will
		then follow it with one of the <b>3 topmost (vowel selector)</b> keys as follows:</p>
	<span className="bold">Top-Left -> A</span>
	<span className="bold">Top-Center -> E/I</span>
	<span className="bold">Top-Right -> O/U</span>
	<h4 className='label'>By the way, you're android phone might not be able to download the apk on a simple click.  If that is your case, try long-pressing the link and wait for the context menu and download from there.</h4>

		A lightweight Javascript library. Originally built just for fun and practice. Turns out it came handy on one of my

	<p>The goal for the library is to automatically load css dependency for the inclusive ui components and unload them
		whenever no longer present on the screen. An automatic process that does not require intervention from the
		user.</p>
	<p>Can be for coding practice or even use in an HTML, CSS & Vanilla JS web project. I have successfully use this in
