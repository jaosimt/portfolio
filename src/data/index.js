			<p>Was a startup company owned by a Pilipino-American.</p>
			<p>
				The Company provides I.T. services, sales & consultancy with address at 11 P. Zamora street, Cebu City,
				Philippines. By now, the company was long gone for reasons that I am not entirely sure. One is that, the
				owner went back to the U.S.

			<ul>
				<li>On-The-Job Training</li>
				<li>Project based Computer Programmer</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				During my second year in college, I took an On-The-Job training as a computer programmer. I was responsible
				on building a quotation system for all the sales and services that the company offers.
			</p>
			<p>
				During my Project based employment, I was restoring a half damage Hospital System originally designed and
				used in the Philippine Armed Forces. How the CEO able to grab such application and who originally built it?
				I never asked. All I have at the time was the excitement to work as all graduates probably have.
			</p>
			<p>
				Part of the modification needed was to convert the applicationâ€™s design from military to civilian. It was a
				painful process since the design especially the templates in adding/admitting patient always comes with a
				military rank and it was all over the system and yes, it was not dynamic. Labels and titles have embedded
				ranks and are manually placed.
			</p>
			<p>
				However a newbie, I was able to revive and revise the application in less than two weeks which I originally
				estimated to be 2 to 3 months. I was very happy and I thought that If I was not lucky, I must be very good.
				Talk about an excited newbie able to pocket a 5k Philippine peso in just a little over a week ðŸ˜‰.
			</p>
			<p>
				Behind the proud and very delighted newbie being able to complete the job way ahead of time is the fact
				that, I was about to lose my job. I totally forgot that I was a project based employee hired to work on a
				one and only project. Ha ha, I laughedâ€¦ but saddened deep inside.
			</p>
			<p>
				Nevertheless, It was an achievement and an experience, my very first in-fact after college.
